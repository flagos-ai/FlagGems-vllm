## Introduction

FlagGems-vllm is part of [FlagOS](https://flagos.io/). It is a high-performance operator library implemented using the [Triton programming language](https://github.com/openai/triton) launched by OpenAI, designed for multiple hardware backends. It provides optimized implementations of common vLLM operators and supports high-performance inference and deployment for a variety of widely used models.

## Features

- Operators have undergone deep performance tuning
- Triton kernel call optimization
- Flexible multi-backend support mechanism
- Support for common vLLM operators (`moe_align_block_size`, `grouped_topk`, etc.)

## Relationship with FlagGems and vllm-plugin-fl

The three repositories work together in the FlagOS ecosystem but have different responsibilities:

- **FlagGems**: The general-purpose FlagGems operator library. It provides common PyTorch/Triton operator replacements and exposes `flag_gems.enable()` / `flag_gems.use_gems()` to register operators into PyTorch dispatch. **FlagGems-vllm depends on FlagGems**, and currently some FlagGems-vllm operators invoke operators from FlagGems internally.
- **FlagGems-vllm**: This repository. It contains vLLM-scenario operator implementations and tests/benchmarks that are aligned with the corresponding FlagGems implementations where the same operator exists. It exposes operators through the `flaggems_vllm` Python package, for example `flaggems_vllm.grouped_topk`, `flaggems_vllm.fused_experts_impl`, and `flaggems_vllm.moe_align_block_size`.
- **vllm-plugin-fl**: The vLLM plugin layer. It uses FlagGems as the global operator backend by importing FlagGems and calling `flag_gems.enable()`. For vLLM-specific fused kernels that are not enabled through PyTorch dispatch, it explicitly imports and calls operators from FlagGems-vllm.

In a typical vLLM plugin environment, the call flow is:

```text
vLLM
	-> vllm-plugin-fl
			-> flag_gems.enable() for general FlagGems operator registration
			-> flaggems_vllm.<operator>() for vLLM-specific fused operators (some calling flag_gems operators internally)
```

This means `FlagGems-vllm` builds on top of `FlagGems`: `FlagGems` provides the common operator foundation and internal utility operators, while `FlagGems-vllm` provides vLLM-oriented kernels and compatibility tests/benchmarks used by `vllm-plugin-fl`.

## Quick Start

### Quick Installation

```shell
pip install -U 'scikit-build-core>=0.11' pybind11 ninja cmake
pip install --no-build-isolation -e .
```

For complete installation steps (including test dependencies, full environment bootstrapping via `tools/setup.sh`, and multi-repository setup with FlagGems and vllm-plugin-fl), please refer to the [Installation Guide](docs/content/en/getting-started/install.md).

### Quick Usage

Since FlagGems-vllm depends on FlagGems, remember to enable FlagGems before using FlagGems-vllm operators:

```python
import torch
import flag_gems
import flaggems_vllm

# Enable FlagGems general operators
flag_gems.enable()

# Call FlagGems-vllm fused operators
scores = torch.randn((8, 16), device="cuda", dtype=torch.float32)
bias = torch.randn((16,), device="cuda", dtype=torch.float32)

topk_weights, topk_ids = flaggems_vllm.grouped_topk(
	scores,
	n_group=4,
	topk_group=2,
	topk=2,
	renormalize=True,
	routed_scaling_factor=1.0,
	bias=bias,
	scoring_func=0,
)
print(topk_weights.shape, topk_ids.shape)
```

For more examples (such as `moe_align_block_size`, `flash_attention_forward`, and `fused_add_rms_norm`), see the [Basic Usage Guide](docs/content/en/usage/basic.md).
